# Next Steps to Get Your Website Running ðŸš€

## Immediate Steps

### 1. Restart Your Computer
Since we just installed Node.js, you'll need to restart your computer for it to be recognized in your terminal.

### 2. After Restart, Open Terminal and Navigate to Your Project
```bash
cd C:\projects\my-first-kitchen
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 4. Start the Development Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 5. View Your Website
Open your browser and go to: `http://localhost:3000`

## What You'll See

Your website will have:
- âœ… **Homepage** with welcome message and featured recipes
- âœ… **Recipes page** with recipe cards
- âœ… **Individual recipe pages** with full details
- âœ… **Shop page** for your baked goods
- âœ… **Mobile-responsive design**
- âœ… **Warm, cozy color scheme**

## Customization Checklist

### 1. Update Personal Information
- [ ] Edit `src/components/Header.tsx` - Update your name/brand
- [ ] Edit `src/components/Footer.tsx` - Update Instagram username and email
- [ ] Edit `src/app/page.tsx` - Update the welcome message

### 2. Add Your Recipes
- [ ] Edit `data/recipes.json` to add your recipes
- [ ] Add recipe images to `public/images/`
- [ ] Update image paths in the JSON file

### 3. Add Your Shop Items
- [ ] Edit `data/shop-items.json` to add your baked goods
- [ ] Add shop images to `public/images/`

### 4. Add Real Images
Replace the placeholder image paths with your actual photos:
- Recipe photos (recommended: 400x300px for cards, 800x600px for pages)
- Shop item photos (recommended: 600x400px)

## Sample Images You'll Need

Based on the current setup, you'll need these images in `public/images/`:
- `chocolate-chip-cookies.jpg`
- `sourdough-bread.jpg`
- `pasta-carbonara.jpg`
- `blueberry-muffins.jpg`
- `chicken-soup.jpg`
- `chocolate-cake.jpg`
- `chocolate-cake-shop.jpg`
- `cookies-assortment.jpg`
- `sourdough-bread-shop.jpg`
- `vanilla-cupcakes.jpg`

## Deployment Options

### Option 1: Vercel (Recommended)
1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
3. Import your repository
4. Deploy automatically

### Option 2: Netlify
1. Build your project: `npm run build`
2. Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com)
3. Drag and drop the `.next` folder

## Troubleshooting

### If `npm` is not recognized:
- Restart your computer after installing Node.js
- Or try using the full path: `C:\Users\ayesha.noorain\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python312\python.exe`

### If you see linter errors:
- These are expected until you install dependencies
- They'll disappear after running `npm install`

### If images don't load:
- Make sure images are in the `public/images/` folder
- Check that image paths in JSON files match your actual filenames
