# Classic Chocolate Chip Cookies

These cookies have been a family favorite for as long as I can remember. My grandmother used to make them every Sunday, and the smell would fill the entire house. I've tweaked her recipe slightly over the years, but the essence remains the same - simple ingredients, made with love, that create something truly magical.

## Ingredients

- 2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 tsp baking soda
- 1 tsp salt
- 1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, softened
- 3/4 cup granulated sugar
- 3/4 cup packed brown sugar
- 2 large eggs
- 2 tsp vanilla extract
- 2 cups chocolate chips

## Instructions

1. **Preheat oven** to 375°F (190°C). Line baking sheets with parchment paper.

2. **Mix dry ingredients**: In a small bowl, whisk together flour, baking soda, and salt.

3. **Cream butter and sugars**: In a large bowl, cream together butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar until light and fluffy.

4. **Add wet ingredients**: Beat in eggs one at a time, then stir in vanilla.

5. **Combine mixtures**: Gradually mix in the flour mixture until just combined.

6. **Add chocolate chips**: Stir in chocolate chips.

7. **Form cookies**: Drop rounded tablespoons of dough onto prepared baking sheets.

8. **Bake**: Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until edges are golden brown.

9. **Cool**: Let cool on baking sheets for 5 minutes, then transfer to wire racks.

## Tips for Success

- **Don't overmix**: Mix just until ingredients are combined to avoid tough cookies
- **Room temperature butter**: This ensures proper creaming with the sugars
- **Cool on baking sheet**: This helps the cookies set properly
- **Quality chocolate**: Use good quality chocolate chips for the best flavor

## Storage

Store cookies in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 1 week. For longer storage, freeze baked cookies for up to 3 months.

## The Story Behind This Recipe

These cookies have been a family favorite for as long as I can remember. My grandmother used to make them every Sunday, and the smell would fill the entire house. I've tweaked her recipe slightly over the years, but the essence remains the same - simple ingredients, made with love, that create something truly magical.

The key is not to overmix the dough and to let the cookies cool slightly on the baking sheet before moving them. This ensures that perfect texture - crispy on the outside, chewy on the inside.

Every time I make these cookies, I think of my grandmother and the love she put into everything she baked. It's a reminder that the best recipes are often the simplest ones, made with care and shared with love.
